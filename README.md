Hi! My name is Jan Lawrence and I am a fresh IT graduate from Arellano University. My hobbies are playing online games and watching people modding their mechanical keebs. My goals for this year is to gain lots of knowledge about Web Development so that I can secure a role as a Full Stack Developer which ofcourse my dream job and to work on a renowned company that has a great salary. The only reason why I took this career is that I love to design and create websites. I also took these opportunity because it is in demand nowadays and provides high income.
